Here is my final project for STAT 201 (Advanced intro to Data Science and Statistics). I found this data on Kapple. 
I cleaned the data as it was necessary for me to get the most accurate result as possible. Overall, my findings were interesting. It opened me to explore a lot ways 
to present my findings through various different graphics and data visualizations.
